{"pages":[{"title":"About","text":"Hi! Welcome to Not Overflow. Our purpose is to help you prepare technical interviews in a more effective way. We are all aware of the existence of many good online coding pratice platforms such as Leetcode, GeeksforGeeks, HackeRrank and etc. But the problem is that they usually contain massive exercises and it’s (almost) impossible and not necessary to solve every single problem. In Not Overflow, we love discovering patterns. We will tell you how to come up with solutions for 10 problems on Leetcode in 20 minutes (This doesn’t include coding time since it differs from person to person) by finding patterns and understanding the core knowledge. We will also provide information on system design interview preparation and some techniques to be more productive during the preparation. This is important since we all have limited time! If you have any question/feedback or would like to join in our team, please drop an email to hi.notoverflow@gmail.com.
